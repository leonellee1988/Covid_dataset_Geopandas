# Covid_dataset_Geopandas

Dear coder.

Statistics are not just very useful... they are amazing!

Do you know what other thing is amazing? Statistics display into a map.

In this repo you are going to learn how to create wonderful maps with 
important information about Covid in the first two months of the pandemic.

Enjoy it and hope it can help you in your own code.
